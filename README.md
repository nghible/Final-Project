## This repository contains the code and data for my "Machine Learning for Handling Missing Data in Wearable Electromyographic Systems" final project.

#### TABLE OF CONTENTS:

1. FuncAndParams.py - This file contains functions and parameters needed to run the rest of the files. Please run this file first.

2. GPboundssim.py - This file contains the simulation to find the optimal bounds for Gaussian Process length scale hyperparameters. Please run this file second.
3. MainSimulation.py - This file contain code that generate results when data under missing-completely-at-random assumptions.

4. GaitMISim.py - This file contain code that generate results when data under gait assumptions.

5. visknndistanalysis.py - This file contains the visualizations, and distributional analysis in the Results section.

6. PCAvsLDA.py - This file contains the simulation to determine between LDA and PCA.

7. CompAna.py - This file generate running time analysis.

8. The rest are data files. Please run the codes in the same fold with the data files.
